Welcome to the RM Life Planner Frontend application - developed for IOS by Spencer Chavez.

This app is designed to combine the helpful features of a personal goal-tracking app with the full functionality of a cloud-based calendar.
I think its full-functionality is best explained with an example, and pictures!



This Swift app works in tandem with the RM Life Planner Backend, found at:
