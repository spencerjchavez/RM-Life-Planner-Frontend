Welcome to the RM Life Planner Frontend application - developed for IOS by Spencer Chavez.

This app is designed to combine the helpful features of a personal goal-tracking app with the full functionality of a cloud-based calendar.
I think its full-functionality is best explained with an example, and pictures!

  To begin, create an account:

  Next, enter some big-picture goals and priorities in your life. I, for example, added "Be the best husband I can" and "Get a full-time job by May 2024." Later, we      will add shorter-term goals to help us focus on achieving each of our big-picture priorities.


  As you can see, RM Life Planner lets you prioritize your desires on a scale from highest priority to medium priority. You will find that all throughout the           app, RM Life PLanner helps keep your first things first, and second things second. (See note1 for more info on the inspiration for this feature).
